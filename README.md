## History of greenairways
 𝓰𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓷𝓪𝓲𝓻𝔀𝓪𝔂𝓼 is a fictonal United-States based carrier in GeoFS. We were founded in 1965. Our inital goal was to create an all-747 airline. Unfourtantly, we had to change our plan by the 1980s. We got rid of all our 747's and replaced them with a300s, a310s, and a320s. We scrapped our previous route plan and replanned it.
 We decided to start out from the San Fransisco Metro Area, since this is where our headquarters were based at the time. We operated to Los Angeles, Sacremento, San Diego, Portland, Pheonix, Seattle, and Vancouver. At this time we renamed to One Californian, then to Golden Gate Airways, then GoldJet. We kept this branding until 2010, where we had major expansion and re-introduced greenairways.
 Since then we have grown a lot. We have two subsidaries, 𝖱𝖴𝖡𝖸𝖩𝖤𝖳 and 𝙗𝙡𝙪𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙠. 𝖱𝖴𝖡𝖸𝖩𝖤𝖳 provides an unparelled and exculsive non-economy experince. This subsidary was founded in 2021, following post-COVID to accomadate buisness and luxury travelers. 𝙗𝙡𝙪𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙠, on the other had was purchased by us in 2014. 𝙗𝙡𝙪𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙠 operates regional jet services around the world.

## What aircraft do we fly?
 We fly a variety of aircraft. Following technical issues with our boeing aircraft in the 70's and 80's. we decided to purchase from Airbus. Airbus at the time was innovating into things never thought possible. We have bought and stuck with them ever since.
 We currently operate the a220, a318, a319, a320, a321, a330, a350, a380, as well as the ERJ145 and ERJ170 for regional routes.
